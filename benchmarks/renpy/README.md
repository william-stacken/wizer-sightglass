To build this benchmark, you need to manually download the [Cubism SDK](https://www.live2d.com/en/download/cubism-sdk/download-native/),
as per this funny [issue](https://github.com/renpy/renpy-build/issues/11).
I tested with `CubismSdkForNative-4-r.6.2.zip`, but it may work with other versions of the SDK. Then extract `Core/include/Live2DCubismCore.h`
and place it in this folder.
